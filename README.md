# CS211D-CCSF-ASMT05
Quiz flash card game. There's a bug, it's gamebreaking. Maybe I already fixed it and nobody noticed.

There's some weird bug in there or something.

This is a realatively simple quiz game for an assignment from Professor Abbas Moghtanei's CS211D.
The dataset can be changed by just altering the array contents.

I may intend on altering the database handler to directly interact with the game class, but also may not.
